To view this project, got to https://nicolekurtz93.github.io/
The website is deployed using Github Pages.

In order to complete this project I made use of two Bootstraps components:

- Accordion ( https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/ ): I made use of the code in the bootstrap example of their
  Accordion component and refactored it to include my own content and altered styling.
- Carousel: ( https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/carousel/ ): I made use of the code in the bootstrap example of their
  Caoursel component and refactored it to meet my styling needs.

The images on my website were from Vecteezy which I have a personal account.
